      <p>I always had an interest in IT and in secondary school I was always busy building simple static websites. At that
        time I was mainly concerned with its design.</p>

      <p>When I finished secondary school this almost completely disappeared because I
        decided to become a soldier. <br>Around 2020, this interest returned and I first started looking for information
        online and soon started distance learning applied computer science. I also did a lot of online courses.
      </p>
      <p>1 year later I got the opportunity to be
        trained as a full-stack developer through Switchfully and I have been programming ever since. I love coding and
        constantly learning new things.

        Although currently im not doing any freelance work, I might in the future.<br>
        Plus I'm open to do some charity work!
